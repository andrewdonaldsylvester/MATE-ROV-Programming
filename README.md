Notes:

https://www.makeuseof.com/raspberry-pi-set-static-ip/ - how to configure a static ip address for the pi.

Main pi ip is 192.168.1.2
Router ip is 192.168.1.1

For mac, when connecting, turn off wifi and go to network preferences. Manually configure with DHCP and make sure your IP is 192.168.1.X where X is neither 1 nor 2 and it is less than 255
